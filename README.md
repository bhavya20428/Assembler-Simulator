This was our project for the course "Computer Organisation" offered in IIITD. In this project, we created a Custom Assembler and Simulator using the concepts of Computer Organisation.

How to run Assembler?

Go to Simple-Assembler and run Assembler.py

How to run Simulator?

Go to SimpleSimulator and run Simulator.py

How to evaluate our Assembler and Simulator?
* Go to the `automatedTesting` directory and execute the `run` file with appropiate options passed as arguments.
* Options available for automated testing:
	1. `--verbose`: Prints verbose output
	2. `--no-asm`: Does not evaluate the assembler
	3. `--no-sim`: Does not evaluate the simulator
